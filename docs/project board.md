We have successfully created our GitHub Project Board to track all Phase 1 tasks and milestones. The board is organized into a clear workflow with three main columns:

📋 To Do - Contains all planned tasks including:

· Setup, plan and verify Bookstore app runs locally
· Create a test plan document
· Create GitHub Project board
· Define team roles and communication plan

🔄 In Progress - Tasks currently being actively worked on by team members

✅ Done - Completed tasks that have been finished and verified

Each task card includes detailed descriptions, assigned team members (Christiana, Ian, or Ronewa), and checkboxes to track completion. The board serves as our central project management hub, providing real-time visibility into our progress and ensuring all Phase 1 deliverables are completed by the November 5, 2025 deadline. The entire team has been granted access as admin to collaborate on the board, and we're using it to coordinate our daily standup meetings and track task dependencies.
