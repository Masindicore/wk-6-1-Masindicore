Communication Channels Established

Our primary communication platform is WhatsApp, where we exchange both text messages and audio calls for quick coordination. For important documents and backup communication, we utilize email to ensure critical files are safely shared. Task tracking is managed through our project board where individual assignments are monitored, and we use pinned announcements on WhatsApp to maintain visibility for crucial updates.

Meeting Schedule Defined

Our team holds daily meetings at 8:00 PM to accommodate everyone's daytime schedules, while maintaining continuous communication throughout the day via WhatsApp messages. Our collective goal is to complete all tasks by the end of the day before the submission deadline to ensure timely delivery.

Decision-Making Process Documented

We employ a consensus-based decision-making process where all team members must agree before implementing any changes. Our coordinator, Ronewa, maintains comprehensive decision records and documents meeting minutes in a shared Google Doc. This approach ensures full transparency, keeping every member informed and aware of the project status at all times.
